### Personal Learnings

Truthfully, with such a heavy workload in a short amount of time, Inhabitent really pushed my to develop a more effiecient work flow. It was a lot to accomplish, so I quickly learned the value of spotting common/repetitive patterns in pages, templates, etc. I think it was a valuable lesson in understanding WP template heirarchy better, and how to build a site with the end client in mind.
